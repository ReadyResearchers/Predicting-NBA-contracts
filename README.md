## VORP_Analysis: Using machine learning to predict how much NBA players are worth in free agency

I want to be able to find how much a NBA free agent should get paid based off of their stats, with a main foucs using VORP(Value over Replacement Player).
I will be using current contracts of players in order to find out how much current NBA front offices view VORP is worth based on VORP and other statistics. 
I will be using the Pandas library to help me with my predictive analysis. I will be getting the majority of my data from ![Basketball-Reference]
(https://www.basketball-reference.com/). I will be able to use pandas to run a predective analysis.
