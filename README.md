## NBA PyAnalysis: Using machine learning to predict how much NBA players are worth in free agency

I want to be able to find how much a NBA free agent should get paid based off of their stats, with a main foucs using VORP(Value over Replacement Player).
I will be using current contracts of players in order to find out how much current NBA front offices view VORP is worth based on VORP and other statistics. 
I will be using the Pandas library to help me with my predictive analysis. I will be getting the majority of my data from ![Basketball-Reference]
(https://www.basketball-reference.com/). I will be able to use pandas to run a predective analysis.


## Installation

In order to be able to run this program. You need to follow the installation process that is outlined below.

`pip install pandas`

In order to be able to run the my computational artifact run this command:

 `python 2020-21.py`
 
In order to run the other program run:

`python Artifact_feasibility.py`


## Abstract

* NBA front office can't effectively sign players to contracts that the players are worthy of.
* Need to be able to find a way to correctly predict how much a player is worth.
* Use NBA PyAnalysis in order to find a players true worth.
* Use a key statistic VORP(Value over replacement player) in order to find the players worth.
* Need to use machine learning in order find the players true worth.
* Have to train the machine learning algorthim wiht past seasons stats and contracts.
* In order to create the required dataframe used a python tool call `pandas`.
